18 February 2014: limma 3.18.13

- Bug fix: the mroast methods for EList and MAList objects were
  ignoring the midp, p.adjust and sorting arguments.

11 February 2014: limma 3.18.12

- The new subsetting code of 12 Dec 2013 introduced a bug whereby
  MArrayLM objects couldn't be subsetted by column name.  Now fixed.

 5 February 2014: limma 3.18.11

- The change to read.ilmn() in 3.18.10 caused an error when the
  Illumina probe IDs were not all unique.  The probe IDs are now used
  as row.names for the annotation data.frame only when they are
  unique.

31 January 2014: limma 3.18.10

- treat() now has new arguments robust and winsor.tail.p which are
  passed through to robust empirical Bayes estimation.

- vennDiagram() wasn't passing extra arguments (...) to plot() when
  the number of sets was greater than 3.  Now fixed.

- read.ilmn() now sets the same probe IDs as rownames for both the 
  expression matrix E and the annotation data.frame genes.

- romer() now uses propTrueNull(method="lfdr") instead of convest().
  This makes romer() substantially faster when the number of genes
  is large.

11 Jan 2014: limma 3.18.9

- update citation of Law et al (2014) reference for voom().

11 Jan 2014: limma 3.18.8

- roast() and mroast() now permit array weights and observation
  weights to both be specified.

- bug fix to mroast() which was not accepting array.weights.

17 Dec 2013: limma 3.18.7

- make sure that F is recomputed when the columns of an MArrayLM
  are subsetted.

12 Dec 2013: limma 3.18.6

- linear model fit functions lm.series(), mrlm.series() and
  gls.series() no longer drop the dimensions of the components of
  the fitted object when there is just coefficient or just one gene.
  Previously this was done inconsistently in some cases but not
  others.  Now the matrix components always keep dimensions.

- New function subsetListOfArrays(), which is used to simply the
  subsetting code for RGList, MAList, EList, EListRaw and MArrayLM
  objects.

 7 Dec 2013: limma 3.18.5

- Bug fix to topTreat().  Rownames were incorrectly ordered when p<1.

- topTable() will now work on an MArrayLM fit object that is missing
  the lods component, for example as produced by treat().

- lmFit(), eBayes(), tmixture.vector() and so on now work even when
  there is only one gene (one row of data).

 2 Dec 2013: limma 3.18.4

- bug fix to genas(), which was not handling vector df.prior
  correctly when the fit object was generated using robust=TRUE.

- genas() now uses fit$df.total from the MArrayLM object.  This 
  prevents df.total from exceeding the total pooled residual df
  for the dataset.  The genas() results will change slightly for
  datasets for which df.prior was very lage.

- bug fix to squeezeVar().  Previously there was an error when
  robust=TRUE and trend=FALSE and some of the estimated df.prior
  were infinite.

- The ctrlpath argument of read.ilmn() now defaults to the same as
  path for regular probes.  This means that only one path setting
  is required if the regular and control probe profiles are in the
  same directory.

- avereps() was never intended to be applied to RGList or EListRaw
  objects.  It now gives an error when applied to these objects
  instead of returning a matrix of questionable value.

- plotDensities() is now an S3 generic function with methods for
  RGList, MAList, EListRaw and EList objects.

13 Nov 2013: limma 3.18.3

- plotFB now an S3 generic function with methods for RGList and EList
  data objects.

- edits to help pages for read.ilmn, neqc, beadCountWeights, voom and
  vooma.  Update cross link to affy::normalize-method in
  normalizeBetweenArrays.Rd.  Remove cross reference to ROC package
  in auROC.Rd.

- Vignette limma.Rnw renamed to intro.Rnw and moved to vignette
  directory.

- bug fix to x-axis label for some plotMA methods.

 4 Nov 2013: limma 3.18.2

- bug fix to topTable() and topTableF() when sorting by F-statistic
  combined with p-value or lfc cutoffs.

23 Oct 2013: limma 3.18.1

- NEWS.Rd updated to reflect changes in Bioconductor 2.13 Release.

- plotMA() is now an S3 generic function.

2 Oct 2013: limma 3.17.26

- Improved error message from loessFit() when locfit package is
  needed but not available.

29 Sept 2013: limma 3.17.25

- loessFit() now uses the locfit.raw in the locfit package when
  weights are provided instead of loess in the stats package.  The
  function now runs very efficiently even on very long data vectors.
  The output results will change slightly when weights are provided.

- Roles of contributors now specified in author field of DESCRIPTION
  file using standard codes.

- Bug fix to subsetting for MArrayLM objects: the df.total component
  was not being subsetted.

- Removing defunct Berkeley Press links to published Smyth (2004)
  article in several Rd files.  Replacing with link to Preprint.

- Adding link to Phipson (2013) thesis in two Rd files.

  and keep constant representing infinity within floating point 
  range.

19 Sept 2013: limma 3.17.24

- roast() now calls mroast() if the index vector is a list.

- Bug fix to mroast(), which had been ignoring the weights.

1 Sept 2013: limma 3.17.23

- New function contrastAsCoef(), which reforms a design matrix so
  that one or more specified contrasts become coefficients.  This
  function is called by roast().

  set.  Previously the weights were ignored when block was used.

26 July 2013: limma 3.17.19

- genas() now returns NA results and a message when no genes satisfy
  the criterion for inclusion in the analysis.

26 July 2013: limma 3.17.18

- argument chooseMethod for genas() renamed to subset.  Option "n"
  renamed to "all".  Some editing of help page and streamlining of
  code for genas().

21 July 2013: limma 3.17.17

- edits to normalizeBetweenArrays help page (i) to further clarify
  which normalization methods are available for single-channel data
  and which are available for two-color data and (ii) to give a cross
  citation to the neqc() function for Illumina BeadChips.

26 June 2013: limma 3.17.16

- bug fix to eBayes(robust=TRUE) when some of the df.prior values are
  infinite.

 5 June 2013: limma 3.17.15

- New merge methods for EList and EListRaw objects.

 5 May 2013: limma 3.17.10
 
- read.ilmn() no longer adds the probe IDs to the gene annotation
  data.frame, leaving them instead as rownames of the expression
  matrix.  It longer creates a targets file since the sample names
  are already preserved as column names of the expression matrix.

- Update mammmary stem cell case study in User's Guide.  As well
  as reflecting changes to read.ilmn() and topTable(), this now
  demonstrates how to find signature genes for particular cell type.

 1 May 2013: limma 3.17.9

- Bug fix to ebayes(), which was not passing the 'robust' argument
  correctly on to squeezeVar().

- Update of mammary stem cell case study in User's Guide.

25 April 2013: limma 3.17.8

- Bug fix to fitFDistRobustly(), which affected the estimated scale
  when df2 is estimated to be Inf.

23 April 2013: limma 3.17.7

- Update Estrogen case study in User's Guide to reflect change in
  rownames of topTable output.

- Update Nigerian RNA-seq case study in User's Guide, adding new
  MA-plot.

- The legend argument to plotMA() can now take a character value
  giving the position to place the legend.  

22 April 2013: limma 3.17.6

- Further fixes to toptable(), topTableF() and topTreat() to
  implement the changes begun in 3.17.5.

- documentation about rownames and column names and the use of
  rownames(fit) and colnames(fit) added to lmFit.Rd.

20 April 2013: limma 3.17.5

- Reverting most of change to getEAWP() in version 3.17.3.  getEAWP()
  now simply preserves the rownames found in object, specifically
  those found in the expression matrix.  Null rownames are left null,
  unless the probe annotation data.frame has row.names, in which case
  these are used.

- toptable(), topTable() and topTreat() now preserve the rownames of
  the fit object, unless the fit object has duplicated names, in
  which case the rownames are copied to the ID column.  Empty
  rownames are replaced with 1:nrow(fit).

15 April 2013: limma 3.17.4

- toptable() and topTable() now preserve rownames of fit object in
  the rownames of the toptable.

15 April 2013: limma 3.17.3

- getEAWP() now forces the output exprs matrix to have unique row
  names.

- fitFDistRobustly() now uses a smoother for the smallest df.prior
  values.  This may result in smaller tail values than before when
  a group of input x values appear to be outliers but the largest
  value is not individually a stand-out value.

10 April 2013: limma 3.17.2

- improvements to help pages for data classes.

 7 April 2013: limma 3.17.1

  when the argument fit is not a valid MArrayLM object.

 4 April 2013: limma 3.17.0 (Bioconductor 2.13 Developmental Branch)
 4 April 2013: limma 3.16.0 (Bioconductor 2.12 Release Branch)

31 March 2013: limma 3.15.21

  largest statistic is not greater than the non-robust df.prior.

- edit acknowledgements in User's Guide.

30 March 2013: limma 3.15.20

  par() settings correctly on exit.

16 March 2013: limma 3.15.16

- bug fix to read.maimages().  Previously was not setting default
  annotation columns for source="agilent.mean".

10 March 2013: limma 3.15.15

- new function voomaByGroup(), similar to vooma() but with different
  variances for different groups.

- vennDiagram() can now plot up to five sets (previously limited to
  three).

- mroast() now outputs number of genes in each set.

- new option method="mean" for propTrueNULL().

- bug fix for fitFDistRobustly with trend=FALSE and robust=TRUE.

4 Feb 2013: limma 3.15.14

- To make the interfaces more consistent, all functions that perform
  gene sets now use the argument 'index' to specify which genes 
  are included in the test set.  Previously this argument was called
  'iset' for roast() and romer() and 'indices' for camera().

- section on time course experiments with many time points added to
  User's Guide.

24 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.13

- documentation added for fitGammaIntercept().

- bug fix to readTargets() to avoid warning message when
  targets$Label is used to set row names but targets$Label
  contains duplicated entries.

16 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.12

- bug fix to read.maimages(), which was not accepting
  source="agilent.mean".

8 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.11

- New function predFCm() to compute predictive (shrunk) log
  fold changes.

- updating help pages for genas().

8 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.10

- mroast() now an S3 generic function, with methods for EList and
  MAList objects.

- mroast() has a new argument 'weights' for observational weights,
  to bring it into line with roast().

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.9

- mroast() now produces a data.frame instead of a list of matrices.
  It also has a new argument 'sort' to indicate whether and how the
  output results should be sorted by p-value.

- roast.Rd now cross-links to the camera help page instead of to
  geneSetTest.

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.8

- camera() now produces a data.frame instead of a matrix, and with
  different columns than previously.  Instead of separate up and down
  p-value columns there is now a column indicating direction of
  change.  A new column gives the FDR adjusted p-value.

- camera() has a new argument 'sort' to indicate whether output
  results should be sorted by p-value.

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.7

- camera() is now an S3 generic function, with methods for EList and
  MAList objects.

- Order of arguments changed for camera().  First argument is now y.

- Order of arguments changed for roast() and mroast().  First
  argument is now y.

29 Nov 2012: limma 3.15.5

- New robust method for estimating the empirical Bayes prior, called
  by specifying robust=TRUE in the call to eBayes().  When this is
  TRUE the output df.prior is now a vector instead of a scalar.
  
- New function fitFDistRobustly() estimates the parameters of a
  scaled F-distribution robustly using Winsorized values.  Outlier
  observations receive smaller values for df.prior than non-outliers.
  This permits robust methods for squeezeVar(), ebayes() and eBayes(),
  all of which now have a new argument wins.tail.p to specify the
  tail proportions for Winsorizing.

- fitFDist() now permits infinite values for covariate.  It also
  gracefully handles cases where the covariate takes only a small
  number of distinct values.  Similarly for eBayes() and squeezeVar()
  that call fitFDist().  

- new function vooma() for computing precision weights based on a
  mean-variance trend.  This is similar to voom() but for microarray
  data instead of RNA-Seq.

- genas() now has the ability to automatically select which probes
  are used for the correlation analysis.  A new argument controls the
  method used for this selection.

- genas() now optionally draws a plot in which ellipses are used to
  represent the technical and biological components of correlation.

- new function fitGammaIntercept() for estimating the intercept of
  a gamma glm with an offset.  (No .Rd file at present.)

- new function propTrueNull() for estimating the proportion of true
  null hypotheses from a vector of p-values.

- new function zscoreHyper() for computing z-score equivalents of
  deviates from a hypergeometric distribution.

- The layout argument for normalizeRobustSpline() now defaults to a
  single print-tip group.

- Additional motivating comments added to normalizeRobustSpline.Rd.

13 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.4

- new function qqf() for qq-plots relative to an F-distribution.

- minor help page improvements for squeezeVar(), fitFDist() and
  trigammaInverse().

13 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.3

- Rewrite details section of read.maimages.Rd for extra clarity and
  to fix a typo concerning the meaning of source="agilent".

- Bug fix for contrasts.fit() when the covariance matrix of the 
  coefficients (cov.coefficients) is not found in the fitted model
  object.  This situation doesn't arise using any of the standard
  limma analysis pipelines.

 8 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.2

- Due to changes in R-devel, loessFit() no longer makes direct calls
  to foreign language code in the stats package, and instead calls R
  functions.  This makes loessFit() about 25-30% slower when weights
  are used.

 4 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.1

- fitFDist() now coerces degrees of freedom df1 below 1e-15 to zero.

 2 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.0 (Bioconductor 2.12 Developmental Branch)
 2 Oct 2012: limma 3.14.0 (Bioconductor 2.11 Release Branch)

 1 Oct 2012: limma 3.13.25

- Two bug fixes for roast() when there are observational weights.

27 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.24

- roast() now accepts observation level weights, through a new
  argument 'weights'.

27 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.23

- Update NEWS.Rd ready for Bioconductor 2.11 release.

26 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.22

- fitFDist() now permits missing values for x or zero values for df1
  with a non-null covariate.  This means that squeezeVar() and
  eBayes() now work with trends even when not all the data values
  are informative.

- Additions to test files to test the above changes, and to test
  eBayes() with trend=TRUE more generally.

25 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.21

- Minor edits to CITATION file and to User's Guide introduction.

9 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.20

- New argument 'file' for convest(), implementing edits contributed

  and 'report'.

6 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.19

- loessFit() calls to foreign language code in the stats package are
  restored.  Will be removed for R 2.16.X.

6 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.18

- loessFit() now applies minimum and maximum bounds to avoid zero or
  infinite weights.  Equal weights are now treated as NULL, even all
  zero weights, so that lowess is called instead of loess.

- plotMDS() now coerces labels to be character.

17 Aug 2012: limma 3.13.17

- limma license upgraded to GPL (>=2) instead of LGPL to match R itself.

- loessFit() no longer makes direct calls to foreign language
  code in the stats package.  Same values are returned as before,
  but now take 25-30% longer whenever weights are used.

16 July 2012: limma 3.13.10

- updated help page for geneSetTest().  In view of recent results
  from Wu and Smyth (NAR, 2012), the claim is no longer made
  that genes might be treated as independent when the experimental
  units are genetically identical mice.

8 July 2012: limma 3.13.9

- plotMDS() no longer gives an error when the requested number of top
  genes is greater than the total number of rows of data.

2 July 2012: limma 3.13.8

- fix to voom() so that it computes weights correctly even when the
  design matrix is not of full rank.

13 June 2012: limma 3.13.7

- new function zscore(). Includes old functions zscoreGamma()
  and zscoreT() as special cases.

- camera() now recognizes array weights as special case of weights.

9 March 2012: limma 3.11.17

- read.maimages() with source="agilent" now reads median foreground
  estimates instead of mean foreground.  New option source=
  "agilent.mean" preserves earlier meaning of source="agilent".

  cases in one of the groups.  geneSetTest() now calls this
  function instead of wilcox.test, with a consequence improvement
  in speed.

22 Jan 2012: limma 3.11.9

- minor edit to topTable.Rd.

19 Jan 2012: limma 3.11.8

  Previously lfc was only used when ranking by t-statistic.

11 Jan 2012: limma 3.11.7

- There were problems with using the argument gene.weights in
  mroast().  This argument is now permitted to be of the same

  automatically subsetted for each gene set.

5 Jan 2012: limma 3.11.6

- new methods "fast" and "affy" for normalizeCyclicLoess().  New
  argument 'cyclic.method' for normalizeBetweenArrays() gives

  all occurrences of each symbol on the array, not just the
  first occurrence.  The argument names of symbols2indices()
  have been changed to be more easily understood.  A new
  argument remove.empty has been added to optionally remove
  gene sets of length zero.  Previously this was always done.

14 March 2011: limma 3.7.25

- minor bug fix to romer(). Change probably not user-visible.

24 February 2011: limma 3.7.24

- bug fix to mroast(), which had been assigning prior.df
  incorrectly for the second and subsequent gene sets.

3 November 2010: limma 3.7.10

- the total df used by ebayes to compute p-values (and therefore
  also by eBayes, topTable and so on) is now not allowed to be
  larger than the total residual df pooled over all probes.
  This limit will normally become active only when the prior df
  is estimated as Inf.  Previously the total df was also allowed
  to be Inf in this case, so that p-values were computed as if
  the t-statistics followed a standard normal distibution.  This
  change will not affect microarray analyses with thousands of
  genes, but can come into play with simulated data or with
  data sets with only a few genes or probes.  In these cases,
  the ebayes p-values now agree with those from a pooled analysis
  in which the genewise variances are assumed equal.

- df.total is now included as a component of the MArrayLM object
  output by ebayes() and eBayes().

- ebayes() and eBayes() now include an option to allow the prior
  variance to be intensity-dependent.  Associated with this is a
  new optional argument 'covariate' to functions fitFDist() and
  squeezeVar().

  correction using negative control values inferred from
  detection p-values.  This is mainly applicable to Illumina
  BeadChip.

  function is changed to "Detection". 

26 October 2010: limma 3.7.6

- .read.oneilmnfile() and read.ilmn() are now careful to return
  the genes annotation as a data.frame, not a character vector,
  even when it only has one column.

26 October 2010: limma 3.7.5

- rbind.EList and rbind.EListRaw now behave correctly when one
  or more of the matrix components are simply undimensioned
  vectors.

26 October 2010: limma 3.7.4

- bug fix to rbind.EListRaw and rbind.EList.  This bug also
  affected neqc() which calls rbind on EListRaw objects.

  visible, except that background intensities are now
  used correctly when the argument RG is an EListRaw object.

  for method="genebygene" (for every 1000th gene).

28 May 2009: limma 2.19.1

- Barnard (1963) reference added to roast.Rd.
- rewording of details in romer.Rd.
- two fixes to contrasts.fit() when there are non-estimable
  coefficients in the linear model.  The function previously
  gave a warning about coercing double to logical, which no
  longer appears.  The function also failed in this situation
  when the contrast was a single vector instead of a matrix.
- convergence criterion for arrayWeightsSimple() is now more
  lenient for large data sets.  About 5 decimal place accuracy
  is still achieved.
- arrayWeightsSimple() now checks for failed convergence
  from floating point errors and returns a diagnostic message.
- getEAWP() and lmFit() now return Amean values for EList
  objects.
- calculation of rotation p-values in roast() and romer()
  changed to be (x+1)/(nrot+1) instead of x/nrot, where x is
  the number of random rotations giving a more extreme statistic
  than that observed.

- bug fix to printHead() to handle object components which
  are neither atomic nor recursive.

13 April 2009: limma 2.17.19

- ebayes() now returns lods as a matrix.  This ensures that
  MArrayLM objects always be subsetted by column names, even
  when there is only one column.
- new argument channels for read.maimages(), which allows the
  function to read one-channel data.
- new class EListRaw for non-normalized one-channel data.
- printHead() now prints compactly for recursive lists of
  arbitrary depth.

03 April 2009: limma 2.17.18

- Bug fixes to the calculations of up, mixed and down p-values 
  in romer().

- further work on plotMDS() to make arguments and help
  page clearer.

27 March 2009: limma 2.17.14

  gene sets as symbols against of vector of gene symbols.

23 March 2009: limma 2.17.13

- New class EList for one-channel microarray data.
- New function plotMDS(), which makes a multidimensional
  scaling plot, using a particular distance measure.

20 March 2009: limma 2.17.12

- Bug fix to rowname assignment for MAList and RGList objects
  containing matrices in 'other' component
- lmFit() warning message on NA coefficients is now more
  refined.  It now appears only when the coef vector is
  partially NA for some probes.
- Fix to gls.series() so that it does not fail when the
  weight matrix contains NA values.

20 March 2009: limma 2.17.11

- biocViews entry of Statistics changed to Bioinformatics

5 February 2009: limma 2.17.10

  is unloaded.  (Not user visible.)
- Some additions to alias2Symbol help page.

15 Jan 2009: limma 2.17.7

  be used to prevent aliases from being expanded if they are
  already official symbols.

14 Jan 2009: limma 2.17.6

- new function plotSA(), which produces a "sigma vs A" plot for
  a fitted microarray linear model.

13 Jan 2009: limma 2.17.5

- paragraph added to details section of roast() help file
  to explain simulation method used to estimate p-values.

4 Jan 2009: limma 2.17.4

- C code dynamic library is loaded when package is loaded
  rather than when it is attached, to enable other packages
  to import limma.  (Not user visible.)
- minor edits to geneSetTest and roast help files.

10 Nov 2008: limma 2.17.3

21 October 2008: limma 2.15.18

- refinements to barcodeplot() to make the graphic a bit prettier

20 October 2008: limma 2.15.17

- new function barcodeplot(), which gives a graphical
  representation of geneSetTest() using ranks.

15 October 2008: limma 2.15.16

- getLayout() with guessdups=TRUE can now handle values
  for ndups greater than 2.
- new function getDupSpacing() which determines duplicate
  spacing from a vector of gene IDs.
- getSpacing() now recognizes a new value "subarrays" which
  means that all the probes on an array are repeated in two
  or more subarrays.
- bug fix to removeBatchEffect(), which previously returned
  an error.

9 October 2008: limma 2.15.15

  is changed to be more discriminating.
- new method "mallowscp" for selectModel().

1 October 2008: limma 2.15.14

- minor improvements to several help files
- correction to the "bic" method of selectModel().

28 Sept 2008: limma 2.15.13

- more efficient memory management in normexp.c (not user-visible)
- argument bg removed from internal functions .normexp.m2loglik,
  .normexp.gm2loglik and .normexp.hm2loglik (not user-visible)

25 Sept 2008: limma 2.15.12

- substantial tidying up of normexp.fit() code, although very little
  of this will be visible to users.  The old pure-R normexp.fit() is
  removed and replaced by the function previously called
  normexp.fit.C().  The old method "neldermead" is now replaced by
  "saddle".  The old methods "bfgs", "nlminb" and "nlminblog" now
  replaced by "mle".
- all user-visible functions previously called by normexp.fit()
  are now removed including: dnormexp(), dnormexp.saddle(),
  normexp.m2loglik() and normexp.m2loglik.saddle().  There are
  now just 4 utility functions, none of which are exported from the
  limma NAMESPACE, namely .normexp.m2loglik, .normexp.gm2loglik,
  .normexp.hm2loglik and .bg.parameters.rma75.
- More comments added to C code supporting normexp.fit().  The
  source code file is renamed from find_saddle_theta2.c to
  normexp.c.
- backgroundCorrect() has a new argument normexp.method to
  specify the parametrization estimation method when for normexp
  background correction.  The options are "mle", "saddle",
  "rma" and "rma75".
- in read.maimages(), support added for ArrayVision data files
  with 'Artifact-removed' (ARM) density values.
- new function selectModel() which implements Akaike Information
  Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion model (BIC)
  selection between alternative linear models.
- new function alias2Symbol() to convert gene aliases to
  official symbols.  Uses the data packages org.Hs.eg.db etc.
- new arguments sort.by and p.value for topTableF().  This makes
  it more consistent with topTable().
- topTableF() now allows the input argument number to be larger
  than the number of rows of the fitted model object.  In this
  case the requested number is set to the number of available
  rows.
- non user-visible improvements to toptable() code.

21 August 2008: limma 2.15.11

- new option "none" for the sort argument of topTable().
- new function roast() which does rotation gene set testing for
  linear models.
- new function treat() which computes empirical Bayes moderated-t
  p-values relative to a minimum required fold change threshold.
- new function removeBatchEffects() which removes batch effects
  from microarray data.
- tableF() now gives a friendlier error message when the fitted
  model object doesn't contain F-statistics.

11 July 2008: limma 2.15.10

- Better treatment of array weights in linear modelling.
  lm.series() and gls.series() now treat array weights as a
  special case, when there are no missing values in the expression
  data and now probe-specific weights.  This means that the array
  weights are now incorporated into fit$cov.coefficients, meaning
  that contrasts.fit() will correctly take array weights into
  account when computing the contrast standard errors, which it
  did not do previously.  It also means that lmFit() is much faster
  when array weighting is used.
- Speed improvement to gls.series() when there are no missing
  values and no probe-specific weights.

16 June 2008: limma 2.15.9

- new capabilities and arguments for write.fit().  The argument
  method allows p-values to be adjusted globally instead of
  separately, and the argument F.adjust allows the F-statistic
  P-values to be adjusted.

11 June 2008: limma 2.15.8

- further bug fixes to getEAWP() when object is of PLMset class:
  weights and Amean components were not being set.

4 June 2008: limma 2.15.7

- new S3 generic function avereps() for averaging over irregularly
  spaced replicate spots.  A method is defined for MAList objects
  and a default method intended for matrices.

1 June 2008: limma 2.15.6

- gls.series() now preserves rownames (probe IDs) of the expression
  object.  This affects lmFit() when ndups>1 or block is non NULL.
  This makes gls.series() consistent with other fitting functions
  lm.series() and mrlm().

22 May 2008: limma 2.15.5

- fix bug introduced to plotMA() in version 2.13.6: plotMA()
  ignored array argument when object was of class RGList.
  Correct function now restored.

20 May 2008: limma 2.15.4

- Cleaning up of source code in find_saddle_theta2.c and
  corresponding calls in background-normexp-mle.R.  No user
  visible changes.  The C code now passes R CMD check without
  warnings, and superfluous utility functions are removed from
  background-normexp-mle.R

12 May 2008: limma 2.15.3

- The optimisation step of normexp.fit is now done in C, making
  a new function normexp.fit.C, speeding up the computation several
  fold.  normexp.fit.C() has two new methods available "nlminb"
  and "nlminblog" which compute maximum likelihood estimates.
  backgroundCorrect(method="normexp") now calls normexp.fit.C()
  with method="saddle".

8 May 2008: limma 2.15.2

- the following obsolete functions (deprecated Dec 2006 in favour
  of read.maimages) are now removed: m.spot, a.spot, read.matrix,
  read.series, rg.series.spot, rg.genepix, rg.quantarray, rg.spot

8 May 2008: limma 2.15.1

- fix bug introduced to plotMA() in version 2.13.6: plotMA()
  was not working for MArrayLM objects.  Function now restored.
- getEAWP() now gets probe names correctly from the rownames of
  exprs when object is of PLMset class.
- edits to read.columns help page to explain that some arguments
  cannot be passed to read.table through ... because they are
  already used by read.columns.

30 April 2008: limma 2.15.0 (Bioconductor 2.3 Branch)
25 April 2008: limma 2.13.10

- getEAWP() now gets probe names correctly from the rownames of 
  object when object is a matrix.

24 April 2008: limma 2.13.9

- normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") now gives an error
  if object is an MAList.
- normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") now uses vsnMatrix()
  when the data object is a matrix.

16 April 2008: limma 2.13.8

- bug fix to normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn").  When the
  function was updated on 14 December 2007 to use vsnMatrix,
  it had not been noticed that vsnMatrix returns log2 results
  whereas the older vsn function returned loge results.  The
  results returned by normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") are
  again now log2, similar to before 14 December 2007.
- method option "neldermean" for normexp.fit() corrected
  to "neldermead"
- deprecated function splitName() removed
- the help page for backgroundCorrect edited for improved
  readability

26 March 2008: limma 2.13.7

- the function rlm.series(), deprecated in 2004, is now removed
- add comments in the geneSetTest help file to warn that the
  test assumes genewise independence. 

8 March 2008: limma 2.13.6

- Streamlining of plotMA() code.  plotMA() should now work correctly
  for any object class that can be coerced to a matrix, for example
  LumiBatch objects.
- lmFit() now warns if coefficients become inestimable due to
  missing values.
- Bug fix when matrix data object passed to lmFit() containing
  missing values.  The check for log-intensities vs log-ratios
  introduced 27 Oct 2007 did not remove missing values and
  hence produced an error.
- New function getEAWP() introduced to unify the treatment of
  different classes of microarray data objects as input to linear
  model functions such as lmFit(), arrayWeights() and
  printtipWeights().
- Class exprSet2 removed.

27 February 2008: limma 2.13.5

- All usage of Biobase's exprSet class removed or replaced with
  ExpressionSet.
- Fortran call in .vsimpleLoess() function updated.

13 February 2008: limma 2.13.4

- all uses of I() in data.frame() arguments removed and replaced
  with stringsAsFactors=FALSE.  This ensures that the appropriate
  columns in data.frames will have class "character" instead of
  "AsIs".
- arrayWeights() now gives nice error message if the number of
  arrays is too few to give statistically useful results.

2 January 2008: limma 2.13.3

- Section on Mutiple Testing Across Contrasts added to the 
  User's Guide.
- The bibTeX entry returned by citation("limma") now uses
  @incollection styole instead of @inbook, thanks to Joern Toedling.

14 December 2007: limma 2.13.2

- update normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") to reflect
  changes in the vsn package version 3.4.1.
- additions to the help file for MArrayLM-class objects

27 October 2007: limma 2.13.1

- lmFit() now tries to guess whether a data matrix contains log-ratios
  or log-intensities.
  When the input data object is a matrix, it is not possible to know
  for certain whether the data are log-ratios or log-intensities, and
  so lmFit() did not set the component Amean in the MArrayLM output
  object.  lmFit() now sets Amean if the input data values are all
  positive, because the data are almost certainly log-ratios in that
  case.

8 October 2007:

Bioconductor Developmental Version 2.2: limma 2.13.0

  backgroundCorrect and normexp help pages.

17 Aug 2007: limma 2.11.10

- topTable() and toptable() have new arguments p.value and lfc, allowing
  users to cut the gene list on adjusted p.value and fold change, rather
  than just taking a set number of genes as before.

22 July 2007: limma 2.11.9

- improvements to the numeric computations of dnormexp.saddle(), which
  is used by backgroundCorrect(method="normexp")
- new function normexp.m2loglik.saddle(), which is the same as
  normexp.m2loglik() but using the saddle-point approximation.
- normexp.fit() has a new argument 'methods'
- default for n.pts in normexp.fit() changed to NULL, meaning use all
  the points.  The rule used to choose the quantiles if n.pts is
  improved to give more nearly unbiased parameter estimators.

9 July 2007: limma 2.11.8

- contrasts.fit() now warns if row names of contrast matrix don't
  match column names of contrasts.
- plotMA3by2 has a new argument 'device' to specify the graphic format.

24 June 2007: limma 2.11.7

- decideTests(method="hierarchical") now passes the adjust.method down
  to the second (t-test) level of testing.  Previously the second level
  testing was always "holm".  The spelling is also corrected from
  "heirarchical" to "hierarchical".

8 June 2007: limma 2.11.6

- new argument n.pts for normexp.fit.  n.pts=2^10 becomes the default
  for method="normexp" in backgroundCorrect().  This decreases
  computation time and introduces some robustness.
- backgroundCorrect() now accepts a matrix argument.

30 May 2007: limma 2.10.5 and 2.11.5

- as.matrix method for vsn objects added.

  is now "global" instead of "nestedF", and heat diagram is removed. 

4 Apr 2007: limma 2.9.17

- bug fix to read.maimages() for source="arrayvision". Now reads
  arrayvision files again for the first time since version 2.3.1.

27 Mar 2007: limma 2.9.16

- new tests for topTable() added to limma-Tests.R
- bug fix to topTable(). sort="M" and resort.by="M" needed to be

  and resort.by="AveExpr" are now allowed.

26 Mar 2007: limma 2.9.15

- bug fix to read.columns, to read SPOT files with a leading column
  of row numbers. Was failing because the number of headers was
  less than the number of columns.

10 Mar 2007: limma 2.9.14

- lmFit() was giving error with marrayNorm object, because of
  incorrect setting of Amean. Fixed.

24 Feb 2007: limma 2.9.13

- write.fit() was using write ambiguous column names for the coef,
  t-statistic and p-value when the MArrayLM object had only one
  column and these components were matrices with one named column.
  Now fixed.
- default changed in write.fit() to digits=3.

22 Feb 2007: limma 2.9.12

- lm.series() gls.series() were returning errors when the design
  matrix was not of full rank and the columns were names.  Bug fixed.

  source files.  Bug fixed.

12 Feb 2007: limma 2.9.10

- functions getColClasses() and namesInFun() removed and replacad
  with the new function read.columns().  read.columns() is a more
  generally useful function which is similar to read.delim() but
  reads specified columns only.
- Argument \dots added to all as.matrix methods for compatibility
  with R 2.5.0.

2 Feb 2007: limma 2.9.9

for Microarray Data" and became part of the Bioconductor project.

11 November 2002: smawehi 0.1

smawehi package made publicly available for the first time, through
the repository http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/smawehi, for the One Day
Course "Statistics for Microarray Data Analysis" at the Australian
Genstat Conference, Perth, Australia, 2 December 2002.  This package
was intended to be used in conjunction with sma from UC Berkeley.

PRE-HISTORY

The limma package was originally called the smawehi package, which was
made public for the first time as SMAWEHI Version 0.1 for the One Day
Course "Statistics for Microarray Data Analysis" at the Australian
Genstat Conference, Perth, Australia, 2 December 2002.  Presenters
were Terry Speed, Gordon Smyth and Natalie Thorne.  The package was
served from an R repository at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au.  With
version 0.9.7 the package was renamed to 'limma' and became part of
the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor.org.
